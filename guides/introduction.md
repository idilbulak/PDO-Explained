# Introduction to PDO

PHP Data Objects (PDO) is a database access layer that provides a consistent way to interact with databases in PHP. It abstracts database access and allows developers to use a unified API to communicate with different database systems.

## Why Use PDO?

1. **Database Agnostic**: PDO supports several database systems. This means that you can switch between different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others with minimal code changes.

2. **Prepared Statements**: PDO supports prepared statements, a critical feature for preventing SQL injection attacks.

3. **Object-Oriented**: PDO utilizes an object-oriented approach, making code cleaner and more maintainable.

4. **Flexible Error Handling**: PDO provides multiple error handling modes, allowing developers to choose the most suitable method for their needs.

5. **Rich Feature Set**: From handling transactions to fetching data in various formats, PDO offers a comprehensive set of features to handle database operations effectively.

## PDO vs. `mysql_*` and `mysqli_*`

The `mysql_*` extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0 and removed in PHP 7. Using it makes your code less secure and prevents you from benefiting from the advancements in newer PHP versions. 

On the other hand, `mysqli_*` (MySQL Improved) is an enhancement over the older `mysql_*` functions and offers both a procedural and object-oriented interface. However, PDO's database-agnostic nature gives it an edge, especially if there's a potential need to support multiple database systems.

## Conclusion

Embracing PDO in your PHP applications ensures a more secure, flexible, and future-proof approach to database interaction. As you dive deeper into this guide, you'll gain hands-on experience and insights into making the most out of PDO's capabilities.
